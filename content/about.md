How I would describe myself in a few paragraphs.

## Who am I?


I am a Computer Science graduate (B.S. 2025) and Data Science student (M.S. 2026) at Colorado School of Mines. I pride myself in how much I've gotten out of my interests and hobbies, such as games (Magic: The Gathering, poker, chess, Scrabble), physical activities (skiing, rock climbing), learning languages (Spanish, Italian), and music (primarily musical theatre currently).

## What am I doing?

I am now in the thick of my last fall semester. I'm trying to develop a solid routine, as I haven't had a particularly normal week so far as of writing this, but I am hoping to spend the bulk of my spare time taking actions to further my career goals, be that working on job applications or on projects. As for extracurriculars, I was hoping to do one of the plays this semester to work on my acting skills and as a social and artistic outlet, but I didn't get into either of them so I opted to do a cappella instead, which provides a similar outlet along with plenty of additional benefits that the plays wouldn't have offered me.

## What are my goals?


I've long wanted a place to catalog my ideas and experiences, so in this website's initial stages, that will be its primary purpose. Ideally, as I continue to work on more projects, it will also serve to showcase and document those.
