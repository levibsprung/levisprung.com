My favorite albums from each week in 2025!
<!--more-->

In 2025, I decided to select an album of the week for each week. I found that I am happier the more music I listen to, so I figured I would listen to a lot of music this year and share some of my favorites throughout the year. 

With a few exceptions, the selected albums aren't necessarily my favorite new releases, but rather the albums that I listened to and enjoyed the most on the respective week (almost always my first time listening to that entire album).

I hope you enjoy reading this and consider listening to some of the albums I selected.

Side note: I do not like or support Spotify (concerns include CEO weapons investments, AI support, and poor artist pay). I would probably switch to Tidal but I am on Spotify's family plan so my hands are tied, and Spotify has some social upside over any other option anyway. *If you are a member of my family reading this, talk to me about the possibility of switching to Tidal.*

- Mexican singer who has jumped a lot between genres and styles but felt very natural in a Latin jazz style with some bossa nova influence
- Lyrical themes meshed with well calm and cozy instrumentals and vocal delivery (for example how can you not adore a Mexican woman singing a song of encouragement directed at a hummingbird)
- Favorite tracks: Pajarito colibrí, El lugar correcto, De todas las flores, Mi manera de querer, Caminar bonito

#### Sep 29-Oct 5: [Avantdale Bowling Club](https://open.spotify.com/album/4rJTVX98bAnFAMfcHmZURM?si=Q7RZ-7kjR5eEdHhdmct0aA) by Avantdale Bowling Club

- Listened to a bunch of post-rock this week (mostly Sigur Rós and Swans) but kept coming back to Racing Mount Pleasant's second album which released earlier this year
- Heavy inspiration from Black Country, New Road but felt far more approachable
- Post-rock has appealed to me as a genre with the way it can combine various types of instruments (percussion, strings, horns, guitars, keys, vocals) in a cohesive way, and RMP's execution of it checked all the boxes for me
- Favorite tracks: Call it Easy, Emily, Racing Mount Pleasant, Your New Place, Outlast

#### Sep 1-7: [...Like Clockwork](https://open.spotify.com/album/5T5NM01392dvvd4EhGrCnj?si=ISjrMGwcQOO621hN4G_CKg) by Queens of the Stone Age

- Not providing much descriptive language here - just listen to it if you haven't already
- Favorite tracks: Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Lucky, Exit Music (For A Film)

- Struck me as sort of an inverse Masayoshi Takanaka: a jazz-samba album at times reminiscent of city pop
- Wafting instrumentals highlighted by unorthodox percussion
- Favorite tracks: need to relisten

- Honorable mention: [Moment of Truth](https://open.spotify.com/album/5f6Nz2v1DESbpu1NerEql2?si=0MieUNxlT0uBKVK3Tic8Dg) by Gang Starr
- Some unique and ethereal sounds from Imogen Heap here

#### Aug 4-10: [Mama's Gun](https://open.spotify.com/album/3cADvHRdKniF9ELCn1zbGH?si=d42d84f9edc547f2) by Erykah Badu
- Started to delve into 90s/2000s neo-soul this week, and this album was my favorite so far
- The tracks flow well into each other, and Badu's vocals complement the smooth instrumentals wlel
- Favorite tracks: Didn't Cha Know, A.D. 2000, ...& On, Bag Lady


#### Jul 28-Aug 3: [Mezzanine](https://open.spotify.com/album/49MNmJhZQewjt06rpwp6QR?si=EubQZ__wQJm-6q0cfIfYMQ) by Massive Attack
* Massive Attack was one of the main pioneers of the trip hop genre, along with Portishead
* Strikes a lot of similar notes to Portishead with relatively slow hip hop-esque beats and somewhat whispery vocals
* Incorporates some heavy sounds with electric guitars and percussion ramping up at certain points
* Favorite tracks: Angel, Inertia Creeps, Group Four, Teardrop

#### Jul 21-27: [Vanisher, Horizon Scraper](https://open.spotify.com/album/6o6VAIetIFOsaOa0qt7w9u?si=uYvZn5oqTG6JKEbocNAELw) by Quadeca
* Good week for new releases, as I really liked [Alfredo 2](https://open.spotify.com/album/5WrpCQmbTUZuzNxGCPUFSV?si=fe627c5ecfc5429a) by Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist, and [Don't Tap The Glass](https://open.spotify.com/album/1jzv3jwZbt8lYfEtMjiD1R?si=6KGANdN7SiaxQ3wAA_toxA) by Tyler, The Creator was a pleasant album as well
* Had high expectations for this album since I was blown away by the singles, but it did not live up to my lofty expectations
* Experimental and stylistically fluid artist, incorporating elements of many genres, some of which I enjoy more (e.g. baroque pop) and others of which I don't enjoy as much (e.g. noise)
* There is also an album movie, which I felt didn't add a ton to the overall experience, although its ending (particularly the last song CASPER) was incredible
* With all being said, an awesome listening experience with the singles pulling plenty of weight in my view
* Favorite tracks: FORGONE, GODSTAINED, MONDAY, RUIN MY LIFE

#### Jul 14-20: [Melt My Eyez See Your Future (The Extended Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/5eXL40WFKPjdCw0NZrRcJI?si=FH5v9pYIQOS3V-iwrNwPLw) by Denzel Curry
* Somehow convinced myself I had listened to this already but that was evidently not the case
* Denzel Curry is a consistently fantastic rapper
* This is some of the more jazzy production that Denzel has been a part of, especially the second disc, which contains fully acoustic instrumentals and no autotune

* Been a huge fan of Arc De Soleil's music since discovering him last summer and his debut album did not disappoint me
